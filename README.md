# Chuks Kitchen - Food Ordering Interface

## 1. Project Overview

**What I Built:**
This project is a responsive frontend interface for Chuks Kitchen, a food ordering service. It allows users to view menu items, add them to a cart, and proceed to checkout.

**Tech Stack:**

- **HTML5:** Used for the page structure and semantic layout.
- **CSS3:** Used for styling, colors, and layout (Flexbox/Grid).
- **JAVASCRIPT:** Used for hamburger menu and categories sections.

**Why I chose these tools:**
I stuck to pure HTML and CSS because the requirements specified no backend or APIs, and I wanted to ensure the code was lightweight and fast.

I also implemented some Javascript for the hamburger menu to make it look better on mobile.

## 2. Project Structure

Here is how the folders and files are organized:

- `index.html`: ← main entry point stays in root folder/
- `/pages/`: Contains all the other pages and they are linked together.
- `/css/style.css`: Contains all the styling rules.
- `/assets/images`: Stores the food images and logos, SVG Icons exported from Figma file.
- `README.md`: This documentation file.

## 3. Design Interpretation

**How I translated the Figma design:**
I broke the design down into three main sections: the Navigation Bar, the Hero Section, and the Menu Grid. I used CSS Grid for the menu items to ensure they align perfectly. I also used flexbox to style some major sections like the navigation bar and the hero section.
