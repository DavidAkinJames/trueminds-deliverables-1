# Chuks Kitchen - Food Ordering Interface

## 1. Project Overview
**What I Built:**
This project is a responsive frontend interface for Chuks Kitchen, a food ordering service. It allows users to view menu items, add them to a cart, and proceed to checkout.

**Tech Stack:**
* **HTML5:** Used for the page structure and semantic layout.
* **CSS3:** Used for styling, colors, and layout (Flexbox/Grid).

**Why I chose these tools:**
 I stuck to pure HTML and CSS because the requirements specified no backend or APIs, and I wanted to ensure the code was lightweight and fast.

## 2. Project Structure
Here is how the folders and files are organized:

* `index.html`: The main homepage file.
* `/css/style.css`: Contains all the styling rules.
* `/assets/images`: Stores the food images and logos exported from Figma file.
* `/assets/icons`: Stores SVG icons used for the cart and navigation.
* `README.md`: This documentation file.

## 3. Design Interpretation
**How I translated the Figma design:**
I broke the design down into three main sections: the Navigation Bar, the Hero Section, and the Menu Grid. I used CSS Grid for the menu items to ensure they align perfectly.
